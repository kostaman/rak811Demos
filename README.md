# rak811Demos
## Introduction
This repository contains simple examples on how to program the STM32L151CB-A processor implemented on the Rak811 chip. This chip 
contains the processor and an SX1276 LoRa transceiver.
The programs use peripherals either implemented on the processor chip itself or on the Rak811 Tracker board. All programs have been developed with STM32CubeMX which generates the peripheral initialization code. This code is included into Eclipse with the Ac6STM32 plugin. Once the program has been successfully built it is flashed into the Rak811 processor using an ST-Link V2 debugging probe. In circuit debugging is accomplished using this probe with the help of openocd and gdb.
## The Blink Demo (Rak811Blink)
The Rak811 tracker board has 2 user programmable LEDs connected to the GPIO port PA12 (LED1) and PB4 (LED2) The Blink program uses a 2 bit binary counter to drive those LEDs. 
## The Timer Demo (Rak811Timer)
This program also uses the LEDs on te tracker board but here the blinking frequency is determined by 2 hardware timers. When the first timer expires it triggers an interrupt at a frequency of 1 Hz. In the callback routine associated with this interrupt the state of the first LED is toggled and the second LED switched on. Then a second 200 ms timer is started and the interrupt generated by this timer will switch the second LED off again.
